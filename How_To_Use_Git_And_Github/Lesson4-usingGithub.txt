it's common to only push one branch to github
you need to create the repo on github, but after that you can do most everything on the command line.

'git remote' with no args will show your remote repo names
'git remote -v' will show your remote repo names and urls (verbose)
'git remote add origin git@github.com:tinyenormous/reponame.git' -> add one repo as remote (called 'origin' by convention)
'git push origin master' will push your local master branch to the origin remote repo.
