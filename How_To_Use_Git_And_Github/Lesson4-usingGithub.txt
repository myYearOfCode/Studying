it's common to only push one branch to github
you need to create the repo on github, but after that you can do most everything on the command line.

'git remote' with no args will show your remote repo names
'git remote -v' will show your remote repo names and urls (verbose)
'git remote add origin git@github.com:tinyenormous/reponame.git' -> add one repo as remote (called 'origin' by convention)
'git push origin master' will push your local master branch to the origin remote repo.

'git pull origin master' will pull changes from the remote to your local repo.

FORKING
forking is a clone that github lets you do directly on their servers. Clone has to be done locally and then pushed back to github. forking is simpler.

'git clone...' automatically adds the github as a remote origin.

conflicting collaboration
sometimes both local and remote are different than the 
'git fetch' will allow you to grab a copy of the remote, but not pull it onto anything. you update origin/master, but not master.
origin/master is the local copy of the origin from the last time you connected to it (/pulled/cloned?)
