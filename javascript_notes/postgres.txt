I used postgres.app from https://postgresapp.com/documentation/ in order to install postgres

postgres
Host	localhost
Port	5432
User	rossdaly
Database	rossdaly
Password	none
Connection URL	postgresql://localhost

the default users are nice in postgres, but they are all super users. 
We need to set up new users with limited permissions. CREATE ROLE is a sql query
that we could use on the database, or we could use the createuser utility that 
is installed with postgres. this utility calls CREATE ROLE for you.

this is the full SQL command
CREATE ROLE username WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'quoted password' [OPTIONS]

you enter it into the psql tool.
postgres=# \password postgres //make a new password, default is blank.
postgres=# CREATE ROLE newuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'boozer232'

then you get this
                                   List of roles
 Role name |                         Attributes                         | Member of 
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
 newuser   |                                                            | {}
 patrick   |                                                            | {}
 postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}
 rossdaly  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB                          | {}

 to add a permission to patrick, enter this

postgres=# ALTER ROLE patrick CREATEDB; 
postgres=# \du 
postgres=# \q # quits

and you get this

                                   List of roles
 Role name |                         Attributes                         | Member of 
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
 newuser   |                                                            | {}
 patrick   | Create DB                                                  | {}
 postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}
 rossdaly  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB                          | {}

but it can be a lot easier using the postgres command line utilities
here are just a few 
	createuser: creates a user
	createdb: creates a database
	dropuser: deletes a user
	dropdb: delete a database
	postgres: actually runs the sql server itself
	pg_dump: dumps the contents of a single db to a file
	pd_dumpall: dumps all dbs to a file
	psql: we just used this to execute the sql queries

using those command line utilities to make a new user
	createuser patrick --createdb

this is how you log in as a specific user
	psql postgres -U patrick

CREATING DATABASES
similarly there are two ways to make a new user
in SQL:
	CREATE DATABASE databasename;
	CREATE DATABASE super_awesome_application;
now the db is created, but no one has access.
	postgres=> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE super_awesome_application TO patrick;
	postgres=> \list
                                          List of databases
           Name            |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
---------------------------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 postgres                  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 rossdaly                  | rossdaly | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 super_awesome_application | patrick  | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 template0                 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
                           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1                 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
                           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
	postgres=> \connect super_awesome_application
	or
	postgres=> \c super_awesome_application
	
	You are now connected to database "super_awesome_application" as user "patrick"                 
postgres=> \dt
this would show us the tables in the currently connected database, but it is empty

as with before, creating a db using the command line utility is simpler, but
you can't manage the db after is is created. to do that you need to use psql

	createdb super_awesome_application -U patrick

DELETE DATABASE
DROP DATABASE database name

GUI APPS
there are two recommended free ones.
https://www.pgadmin.org/ and https://eggerapps.at/postico/
pgadmin looks like it has better features, but is worse looking.
