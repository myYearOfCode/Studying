take generative notes
	reframe and reword what the instructor is saying. don't take verbatim notes, as you are simply doing a typing test at that point. Try to be as brief as possible, while still encapsulating all of the concept.
review early and often
	review the notes after the lecture. find the highlights and note them. this is also a great time to write up some test questions.
	review again after a few more days, and ideally a few days after that.
test yourself
	this is a great way to reinforce the lessons, and also a way to identify the subjects that could use some more study time. moving the subjects that are mastered into the 'reinforce in a few days' category helps to free up review time for more difficult subjects.
carefully think about how you want to take notes
	laptops are faster than handwritten notes, but speed isn't everything. the 'slowing down' required with pen and paper is itself a useful thing. laptops can be good for code as they provide copy pastable content, but even that should be discouraged while learning.
be mindful of misperceptions about learning
	just because it is easy to understand a concept the first time does not mean that you will remember it.
