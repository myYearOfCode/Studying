linked lists
disadvantage:
slow to get to the end of the list. Linear time! O(N)
advantages:
insert or delete can be very fast, if they are at the beginning of the list. O(1)

doubly linked list each element is linked to it's child and parent.

in java she makes it as an object with some methods and attributes
attributes are next and 
append, prepend, and deleteWithValue methods
append is simple. walk to the last element, and add your new node to the next value
of the current last node
prepend is pretty easy as well. simply set your node's next value to be the current head. 
then update the global head value to be the new head. 
deleteWithValue walks the list until it is one before your search term. then set
the next value to next.next. this essentially cuts out the node you wanted to delete.
nothing is deleted, but it is out of the chain and won't bother us any more.
