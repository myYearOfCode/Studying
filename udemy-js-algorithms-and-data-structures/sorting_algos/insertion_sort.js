// INSERTION SORT
// BIG O = O(n^2) BEST = O(n) SPACE = O(1)
// actually has a few use cases.
// it is useful if the data is mostly sorted.
// insertion sort is useful for an 'online algorithm' meaning data is coming in live and you need to sort it live.
// it builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left portion which is always sorted
// start with one element, then sort the second element into that 'list'
// then add the next element into the list.
// each element bubbles down until it is in place.
// 	it seems like this could be combined with binary sort or something else in order to limit iterations.
