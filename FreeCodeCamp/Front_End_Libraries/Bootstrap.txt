these notes are nothing like the react ones largely because the bootstrap concept is so much simpler.

Making a responsive design with bootstrap.
put a "container-fluid" tag on an enclosing div to have it resize to fit the screen.
you include bootstrap in an html file with
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/..." integrity="stickmd5 sum in here" crossorigin="anonymous">
you can center text with "text-center"
all of bootstrap seems to be about adding class names to elements.
buttons have "btn" styles as well
making a button a block style will make it as wide as it's enclosing space.
btn-primary is a dark blue color
btn-into is a lighter blue
btn-danger is red, and used for destructive actions.
bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column(!) grid
col-md-#
col indicates this is a placement tag
md indicates this is used for medium screen sizes
# is a number indicating how many columns it takes up

you can add multiple col tags for different size screens
font awesome icons
you include font awecome with a declaration similar to the bootstrap one.
i tags or span tags are used to contain icons
<i class="fa fa-info-cycle"></i>
the icon name is after the "fa-" is "fa-trash"
adding icons makes a page look better quickly
bootstrap wells are darker rounded divs
