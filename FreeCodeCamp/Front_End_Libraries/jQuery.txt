FCC jQuery 20181101
running jQuery requires a script tag at the top of your html
this line only runs js after the page has loaded.
	$(document).ready(function(){ js code in here });
they call $ 'bling'!
to make all buttons bounce
	$("button").addClass("animated bounce") // this req some animation stuff to be imported previously.
The $("button") part is the selector
The rest is telling jQuery what to do with the selection.
removeClass() does what you expect
.css() allows you to changs the css of an element.
.css("color", "red"); //note that the formatting is different than css
.prop() lets you modigy the properties of an element
you can disable buttons with 
	.prop("disabled", true)
.html() lets you overwrite the content between the opening and closing tags
.text() lets you overwrite the text but not the inner html. idk how this works.
.remove() deletes an entire element
.clone() makes a copy of an element. are they linked in the future, or are they fully independent?
$("#target").clone().appendTo("#left-wall")

1 and 2 are each functions. this is called "function chaining"

.parent() targets the parent of the selector passed into it. chain it like a clone
.children() targets the children. this can have multiple results, while parent is either 1 or 0.
.target:nth-child(n) is a selector (ie it is in quotes) for the nth child of an element with the class "target"
	this doesn't work like I expected it to. it doesn't move down a tree finding children of children. it looks at one level and selects every nth sibling at that level
:odd select odd # elements, NOTE this index starts at 0. don't get it twisted.!
. = class name
# = id name
"" = tag name
